A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. You might want to use a language as Python which is also good for this Master! The Code can be relatively simple (as a simple game with console output).

B) Make sure each Person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:

UML (at least 3 diagrams)
Metrics (at least two. Sonarcube would be great)
Clean Code Development (at least 5 points you can show me)
Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc.
Continous Delivery (show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins and Travis-CI)
AOP (show me where you could have integrated AOP stuff => the jointpoints)
DSL (Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project)
Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional definitions in your code as
	only final data structures
	(mostly) side effect free functions
	the use of higher order functions
	functions as parameters and return values
	use clojures / anonymous functions
Show me an idea where to use a logical solver in your code and how you would do it!
Write a little code fragment (like data preparation etc.) in Scala or Clojure!

Please give me a hint as a checklist with one sentence for each 1-9 where I can find the info for points 1-9!!

The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section (@edlich).

The complete documentation must be found in the GitHub doc (e.g. ReadMe or Wiki). It should explain also B  in three pages.
